## PATCH NOTES FOR CURRENT VERSION (v2.3.25)

**Tank Updates:**
Due to uneven advantages in various combat, multiple tanks have received appropriate adjustment.

Cannon: The difficulty realized by the riot shield mobility, prompted the addition of a useful feature. Players can now control the placement of the riot shield, via the front or the back of their respective tank.

Sniper: As seen in its dominance on the battlefield, the sniper tank's abilities has been greatly reduced. Players will not be able to fire its weapon while invisible, without terminating its ability. Additionally, the damage of the projectile shot from a sniper tank, is reduced from 350-550HP to 300-425HP.

Double: In awareness of the ineffectiveness of the trophy system, the trophy synonym will receive an update. The trophy system's effective radius will increase from 2.0 tank-lengths to 2.5 tank lengths. Additionally, incoming explosive ordinances will only reduce it's functioning time range by 12% rather than 15%.

Pyro: Concerning the unethical use of spamming the flamethrower ability to garner an infinite flamethrower functioning time, the pyro tank, and consequently all of the UI panel has received an update. Players can only use his ability after double the original waiting time. Additionally, ability enabling through cursor clicking has been deactivated for all tanks.

In addition to these specific tank updates, the following abilities can now be disabled if already enabled: Railgun's high powered laser, Recon's move mark, Recon's airstrike, and Scout's Thermal.

**Zombie's Gameplay:**

Due to spawn issues and the growing concerns over the gameplay, the zombie game mode has received a vital update. Zombies will now spawn closer to the player objective, decreasing the wait time and increasing the difficulty of the game. Additionally, zombie's spawn distances are set based on their respective pace, with slow zombies spawning closer, and faster zombies spawning farther.

**Bug Fixes:**
Various gameplay issues have been resolved with this new update.

Peer skin costumes will not persist on other's screens if they exit the game.
Skin costumes will now effect the gauss water filter if player tank happens to ignite.
Skin costumes will now effect the brightness filter if player tank happens to be damaged by oncoming projectiles or explosions.
Kerosene's will not disappear upon the constant pressure emitted by the flamethrower ability.
The chance of host spawning at the center of the Shipyard map has been reduced to zero.
Additional Updates:
Upon the requests of the players themselves, the following features have been added:

Host can now choose the amounts of bots spawned in their hosted games in the Host Settings page.
Players can now select or spawn in a different type of tank if enabled by host on the Host Settings page.
This is an important update as it brings us one step closer to publishing a fully workable, entertaining experience.
