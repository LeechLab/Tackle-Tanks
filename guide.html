        <h4 id="history"><br />History and Origins</h4>
        <p>
          The first version of this game started on MIT's Scratch, created by
          the user Rboombox. This version has only campaign missions; there is
          no multiplayer mode available. Being the basis of Tackle Tanks, there
          are no abilities or powerups in this version. The game is still
          playable as of now.
          <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/553792334/"
            >Click here to play this version!</a
          >
        </p>
        <img class="imageLeft" src="HTML_images/Guide_Html/ttiov1.png" />
        <p>
          As Rboombox, I was inspired by the other io games on the internet, and
          decided to make one myself. Using Javascript, HTML5, and CSS we made
          the first version and publish it November 2022. The game has now had
          multiple updates, such as having two abilities for each tank. There
          were also updated guns and machinery, maps and objects, and the
          implementation of shop. This version of Tackle Tanks is now what you
          see today.
        </p>
        <h5>
          This beta version is no longer available. Older versions of Tackle
          Tanks are overwritten by the newest version.
        </h5>
        <p>
          In this new update -- Tackle Tanks v2 as of January 2024 -- there are
          major improvements. Most of the art and style of the game is upgraded,
          as well as the abilities and weaponry of each tank. The main problem
          of the old version was how laggy and slow it ran. This version runs
          smoother and can handle more objects!
        </p>

        <p>
          Other updates include: new game modes, more skins, upgraded scoring
          system, better effects and particles, better options/settings, ect.
          This game guide is another advancement as well. If you are trying to
          find any information about how something works, search it up in this
          game guide--you are sure to find it!

          Since we are all for transparency, you can see all of the scripts and
          programs that will run on your browser as you're playing the game. To
          check this out,
          <a href="https://github.com/LeeechLabStudios/Tackle-Tanks"
            >click this link</a

          If you find errors/bugs or you have a suggestion for the game, submit
          a statement in the Issue category. You'll have to create an account in
          order to do this.<br /><br />
          We do not care if you try to make a modded game. Some of the scripts
          that runs the server connection, like
          <a
            href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeeechLabStudios/Tackle-Tanks/gh-pages/scripts/c3runtime.js"
            >c3runtime.js</a
          >, may help you in your journey. We don't know how you'll accomplish
          this, but remember that we do not have any part of your creations.
          Maybe in the future we will create a program to assist in creating
          mods (This hasn't changed as of right now). If you are successful
          creating a modded server, we encourage you to share how you did this
          with the world.
        </p>
        <h3 id="serverOptions"><br />Server Options</h3>
        <p>
          This section of the guide will recapitulate each function of a server.
          In order to join a game, click play, scroll through the game list, and
          then join the game. In order to host a game, click play and then host
          a game. This will lead you to a page of game options, titled "Host A
          Game". Make sure your device can handle multiple calculations and
          rendering if you do this. Low-end processors may result in lag for you
          and your players. Also, to clarify most misconceptions, hosting a
          server is FREE.<br /><br />
          The first thing that appears is the map options. In order to change
          how people can select the next map, select "Change of Map". "Map vote"
          means that after a game, your players can vote on the next map (this
          poll is open for 30 seconds). Random means that the next map will be
          arbitrary. The rest of the options means that the map is always
          constant (Ex: If you select "Grasslands Only", the map will stay as
          Grasslands until the host leaves). If you select these options, you
          will not be able to change the "Starting Map". Otherwise, if you click
          "Starting Map", this will change the first map in your game.
          <br /><br />In order to change the size of the field, click on "Map
          Size". The options, Small, Medium, and Large, are exactly what they
          represent.
        </p>
        <h5>
          IMPORTANT: Some server options may be immutable based on certain
          gamemodes! (Ex: If the gamemode “Zombies" is selected, the amount of
          players will change. If the gamemode "Mini Arena" is selected, the map
          size will change to Mini). Check out each gamemodes to see every
          limitation!
        </h5>
        <p>
          After the map segment there is a "Gamemode" segment. There are only
          two options you can change here. The first option will change the
          actual objectives and style of the game. To see each gamemode and
          their rules, go to the
          <a href="#teamdeathmatch">Gamemode<sub>[25]</sub></a>
          guide.<br /><br />The next option is "Time Limit". Exactly as it's
          written, this represents the amount of time for each round. The
          default is 15 minutes, but the maximum amount is an hour (the minimum:
          1 minute).<br /><br />The next segment is the "Tank" category. The
          first option changes the number of players PER TEAM. This said, if the
          number of players per team is 50, a maximum of 100 players can join
          your server because there are two teams. The next option is titled
          "Select your tank". It can either be disabled or enabled. Disabling
          this will result in players receiving a randomly selected tank. If
          enabled, players can choose their tank. They can only do this each
          round though, changing the tank is not allowed during the match.<br /><br />After
          this, there is an option to designate what tanks are allowed in your
          game (Titled, "Allowed Tanks"). By default, all of the tanks are
          selected. You can unselect a tank be clicking on it, changing the
          color to be gray. Gray obviously means it's unselected. If you think a
          tank will not suit your needs, unselect it. At least one tank should
          be selected.<br /><br />The last option is "Automated Bots". You can
          enable/disable if your game has bots. A bot will be destroyed after a
          player has joined. If a player leaves, a bot will be created. Bots
          will also even out a team. If disabled, there will be no bots at
          all.<br /><br />The very last segment is the "Advanced" section. The
          first option is "Dedicated Server". This implies that, if enabled,
          when you host the game, the game will automatically run until you end
          it by clicking "End Server". In basic terms, if your computer is left
          on for 24/7, your game will stay up and running. Even though it is
          healthy for your computer to run 24/7, this may affect your internet
          usage. Check your internet provider to see if running this will stay
          in your price range. Otherwise, just disable this. It's really
          unnecessary, but it's an option you can select.<br /><br />Lastly, the
          final option for hosting the game is the "Public/Private Game"
          selection. If it's public, anybody can find your game and join it. If
          private, the only way to enter the game is if you have a code or url.
          If you select "Private", invite all your friends by sending them the
          link.<br /><br />After you decided on all of these options, tap "Host
          Game", and the server will start. Remember that creating a server will
          run programs, manifesting multiple calculations every second. This
          game is designed for average computers, so even though you might not
          have the best PC, you can still make a game and play with your
          friends.
        </p>
        <h4 id="settings"><br />Settings and Each Function</h4>
        <p>
          Just like the "Server Options" part above, this is a recapitulation of
          each option. To change how your game works in Settings, click the
          setting symbol located on the top right corner of the home page. This
          will bring you to a page labeled "Settings". There are a number of
          settings to change, so modify each option to create the best gameplay
          possible.<br /><br />The first segment on this page is titled
          "Gameplay". The first option enables or disables Screen Shake. As the
          name implies, your screen will shake or rumble when you are near an
          explosion (Ex: Let's say you are underneath an airstrike. Your screen
          will shake like crazy!). Disable it in order to get rid of this. The
          next option is titled "Dim Flashbang". When you are flashbanged by a
          <a href="#sniper">Sniper<sub>[21]</sub></a
          >, your whole screen turns stark white. This might result in temporary
          blindness and damage to the retinas if you are playing in a dark room.
          When you enable "Dim Flashbang" this will change the flashbanged
          effect to become black instead of white, saving your eyes!<br /><br />The
          next option is "Anonymized Usernames". As the name implies, you will
          play against friendly default names (Ex: "BraveOperator", or
          "UsefulTank"). This will also disable kill feed. This is automatically
          set to disabled, so you might see inappropriate names. The final
          option for the Gameplay section is "SFX Volume". This changes the
          volume for all sounds in the game.<br /><br />
          The next section is titled "Key Bindings". To change a key for any
          action, click on the action's button and press a key. If you press the
          escape key or a key that already exists for another action, the key
          will not change. You cannot set the keybinds to Escape or the Arrow
          keys.<br /><br />The first four keybinds of the settings is "Move Up",
          "Left", "Right", and "Down". The WASD keys are the defaulted for the
          movement of your tank. Also, the arrow keys are constant for moving
          the tank. So regardless of what keybinds you use for movement, you can
          always rely on moving your tank with the arrow key pad.<br /><br />The
          next keybind is "Alternate Shooting". The name implies that there is a
          main button used for shooting. This is the left mouse button, which is
          constant. Some tank' powerups (Like
          <a href="#heavy">Heavy's<sub>[16]</sub></a> Grenade Launcher) or main
          gun (Like <a href="#Snipers">Sniper's<sub>[21]</sub></a> gun) allows
          you to aim when you click the right mouse button. This is constant as
          well.<br /><br />
          The next button is "Reverse". This button, when held, will move the
          tank backwards. So if you move your tank and press the reverse key,
          you still move in the correct direction, it is just the back of your
          tank that faces the direction. This is helpful in some cases,
          especially for <a href="#cannon">Cannon's<sub>[10]</sub></a> Riot
          Shield ability. The default for this key is Shift.<br /><br />The next
          to keybindings you can edit is "Activate Left or Right Ability".
          Naturally Q and E, these buttons activate the ability your tank has.
          If you activated the ability, and press the same key again, it
          deactivates the ability. Deactivating before the main cooldown of that
          ability may result in less cooldown.<br /><br />The next ability is
          "Detonate", which is defaulted to the X key. This is meant for certain
          gadgets your tank might have. For instance if you are a
          <a href="#mechanic">Mechanic<sub>[12]</sub></a> tank and you activate
          your RC Car ability, you can explode your car early by holding the
          detonate key.<br /><br />The next bind you can edit is the "Show/Hide
          Chat" key. This key, as implied, shows or hides the chat if clicked,
          and the default is T. To add on to that, the next keybind allows you
          to chat. This key is naturally ENTER. In order to actually message
          people, you first tap this key, then type whatever message, and then
          press ENTER. Regardless of what key you set this to, ENTER will
          ultimately send the message.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Messaging in Chat is global! There is no team chat. Make sure you
          don't inform the enemy about your whereabouts.
        </h5>
        <p>
          The last keybind is "Show/Hide Scoreboard and Menu". As the name
          implies, this key when clicked will show the scoreboard and other menu
          options. This key by default is TAB.<br /><br />Finally, the last
          section in the Settings page is "Advanced". Here, there are some
          settings people normally don't look for. The first option is to show
          FPS and Ping. FPS is basically the refresh rate your computer runs. An
          average computer might run at 60 Frames Per Second, but if something
          that causes your computer to lag (like high CPU usage from this game,
          or some internet troubles), your FPS will decrease. You will notice
          this naturally when you see lag. Ping (the technical term is latency)
          means the time it takes for data to be transmitted from your device to
          the server. When you join a game in Tackle Tanks, if the Host lives
          somewhere very far from you, lagginess will show up. If you enable FPS
          and Ping, you can see how much time data reaches your server and back.
          20 m/s or less is a very great ping. 100m/s or more is a bad ping. If
          you are a host, your ping is 0 m/s, because you are the connector.<br /><br />The
          next two options are "Effects" and "Particles". There are various
          effects in Tackle Tanks. For example, when you see fire in the game,
          you visibly see orange flames stretching and dilating. This motion is
          caused by an effect by our software. Particles on the hand, are
          objects you see. When you are in any of the maps, you will see
          flowers. These flowers are particles. Particles have no collision, but
          it takes space, making the CPU usage rise. More CPU usage means more
          lag. If your computer can't handle these particles and effects,
          disable both of these.<br /><br />"Object Limiter" is the next option.
          Here, you can set the number of objects in your game. Trees, rocks,
          anything with collision, are mandatory objects. Since there around
          1000 mandatory objects in any given game, this is set as the minimum
          number. If you enter a number below this, it will set it to 0, meaning
          there is no limit. The maximum is 2000 because it is not possible for
          this game to have more than 2000 objects at a time. Some objects might
          not disappear if you are the host.<br /><br />Lastly, the final option
          is the red warning button. This is asking to clear ALL of your user
          data. There is no going back if you click this option. All your skins,
          stats, even your settings, will disappear. Your progress will be
          reset. Don't worry, if you accidentally click this, another warning
          prompt will appear. Here you can click cancel.<br /><br />
          After editing and modifying everything to suit you needs, scroll at
          the very top of the page. Here, you can click "Save". Do not click out
          of the page because it will not save. There is another button titled
          "Reset to Default". As the name implies, if you click it, it will
          reset all of the settings, returning everything to the default.
        </p>
        <h3 id="basicgameplay"><br />Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          The mechanics of this game is very simple, allowing all players to
          enjoy. Each user is a tank. You can control the tank by moving up,
          down left, or right (default is WASD, arrow keys are constant). You
          can aim and fire using your gun or ability (Default is left mouse to
          shoot and right mouse to aim, Space is constant). Every tank has a
          main weapon and two secondary abilities. There are limits. Gun Cool is
          a variable that affects your firing. Each tank afflict this variable
          at different speeds. For example, the
          <a href="#sniper">Sniper Tank<sub>[21]</sub></a> can only fire three
          times back to back until the gun heat disallows you to shoot. The gun
          will have to fully cool in order to shoot again.<br /><br />The
          abilities have limits as well. Every ability will have timer based on
          how powerful they are. For example,
          <a href="#recon">Recon's Airstrike<sub>[20]</sub></a> has a cooldown
          of 120 seconds before it can be used again. This is because the
          airstrike is massive and has a devastating effect. Each tank has at
          least one defensive and one offensive ability.<br /><br />The baseline
          integrity for all tanks is 1000hp. In order to fully destroy a tank,
          you must deplete their health. There are three types of damage,
          Explosive damage (may be referred to as “Area damage”), Impact damage,
          or Continuous damage. Impact damage is the damage caused by collision
          of a projectile (For example,
          <a href="#cannon">Cannon's cannonball<sub>[10]</sub></a> damages when
          it collides against a tank). Explosive damage, as the name suggest, is
          damage caused by explosions, an area effect, contrary to impact. If a
          kerosene can blows up, it causes damage over a short period of time
          (the longer the tank is in range with the explosion, the more damage
          the tank receives). Explosive damage, decreases the farther away you
          are from the explosion. Continuous damage is damage caused when a
          substance is within contact with your tank. (For example, each of
          <a href="#corrosive">Corrosive’s particles<sub>[24]</sub></a> damages
          your tank when it’s touching you). This damage is usually small, but
          can build up insidiously. <br /><br />After each match, you are
          rewarded Scraps (in-game currency) based on what you did on the
          battlefield. Even though you might have lost the match, you will be
          rewarded. During the game you can find your stats by pressing the
          Leaderboard button in the bottom right corner.
        </p>
        <h5>
          To save your scraps, make sure you click the leave button. Anything
          else (reloading, back page, ect) will result in a loss of your hard
          earned rewards. Scraps are automatically saved after each match.
        </h5>
        <p>
          The scraps you earn can be used to buy different skins. These skins
          are located back on the main page in the top left corner, labeled
          “Shop”. Here you can also find the amount of Scraps. Once you click
          the shop button, you will land on the shop page, where you can select
          the skins you want to equip and buy skins if you have enough Scraps.
          We might add more types of items in the future.
        </p>
        <h4 id="biHUD"><br />Basic User Interface and HUD</h4>
        <p>
          This section will give you all the information about the basic user
          interfaces. The UI that are purposed for a certain gamemode, like
          <a href="#capturethebases"
            >Capture The Bases's Base Information<sub>[26]</sub></a
          >, will be explained in the Gamemodes category. Any other general
          interface will be explained here.<br /><br /><img
            class="imageRight"
            src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\HealthUI.png"
          />The first and most prominent design you might find is the health and
          gun temperature indicators. The health bar, as named, tells you the
          total integrity of your tank. Another indication of your health would
          be the damage indicated on your tank. Your gun temperature is marked
          by the red gauge. The higher the temperature, the more it reaches the
          end point. If the end point is reached. A red LED will flash on,
          indicating that you can no longer fire.<br /><br />Just above the
          health bar is two abilities. Both abilities can be clicked to activate
          it (or re-clicked to cancel). After the ability is used, the button
          will turn dark and display the time it takes until you can activate it
          again.<img
            class="imageRight"
            src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\leaderUI.png"
          /><br /><br />The next interface can be seen in the top left. Here,
          you will find the current objective and the time until the match ends.
          Below the time you will see the current Tackle Leader. The Tackle
          Leader tally will be shown based on gamemode (For example,
          <a href="#capturethebases">Team Deathmatch's<sub>[25]</sub></a> Tackle
          Leader is based the amount of XP you earn).<img
            class="imageRight"
            src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\KillUI.png"
          /><br /><br />In the top right corner you will find the kill feed. If
          you destroy another player, it'll show here. If you accidentally
          destroy yourself in any case, it will also show up in the Kill Feed.
          If you are destroyed, you will land on the spectate page. Here you'll
          find the current person you're watching and arrows to change who you
          want to watch. You can see their current gun cool and integrity (in
          the place where yours would be). After 10 seconds, you can click the
          respawn button to respawn (if there is respawn in the gamemode you are
          playing).<img
            class="imageMain"
            src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\allUI.png"
          /><img
            class="imageRight"
            src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\DetonateUI.png"
          /><br /><br />
          In certain cases, you can control a gadget. Each gadget that you can
          control will either have a "Detonate" button or a “Recall” button.
          Just as the name suggests, you can click this button (or press the
          default key "X") to detonate or call back your gadget. You will not be
          able to see your integrity, guncool, or power ups during this time.<br /><br />
          Finally, each tank has their own cursor. This cursor will always face
          the direction you would want to fire. Make sure that you nozzle is in
          the direction to fire before you do shoot. Every tank has a rotate
          speed for their turret. It takes about 1.25 seconds for your nozzle to
          turn 180 degrees.<br /><br />
          There are other small and minor UI, such as the pop up to select your
          tank, but it's very self explanatory.
        </p>
        <h4 id="TAPS"><br />Targeting and Ping System</h4>
        <p>
          Targeting enemies is another key factor in this game. Certain power
          ups, passive abilities, and gadgets have the ability to ping an enemy
          tanker (for example,
          <a href="#scout">Scout's UAV<sub>[19]</sub></a> pings enemies as you
          fly over them). <br /><br /><img
            class="imageRight"
            src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\PingUI.png"
          />
          If someone pings an enemy, everyone on their team will be able to see
          the ping. In order to see the ping, there are arrows that point to the
          enemy on your screen (there is a radius around your tank that provides
          pointers). An enemy will not know that they are pinged, nor their
          team. This goes for your team as well: everyone in your team are
          vulnerable of being targeted without them even knowing it.<br /><br />
          If you target an enemy, the ping's highlight will not last forever. It
          will disappear after about 5 seconds. <br /><br />There are other
          pointers that are not targeted enemies. Yellow arrows are created by
          <a href="#recon">Recon's Move Marker<sub>[20]</sub></a
          >, which points you in the general direction of where most of the
          enemy team is (or whatever your fellow Recon targeted).
          <a href="#capturethebases">Capture The Bases<sub>[26]</sub></a> also
          displays pointers. A team colored arrow (green or orange) will point
          towards a base. The greener it is, the more the Green Team captured
          the base, the more orange, the Orange Team. The more white the arrow,
          the more neutral the base is.
        </p>
        <h4 id="xpmeritsystem"><br />XP Merit and Scoring System</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\XPUI.png" />
        <p>
          XP, also known as your score, is earned by doing various actions that
          will propel you to team victory. There is no way to lose XP, you can
          only be rewarded. The more XP you earn, the more Scraps you earn. In
          most game modes, Tackle Leader is based on someone who earns the most
          XP. At the end of a match, you are rewarded scraps based on the team
          win ratings, how much XP you earned, and the placement you are in. if
          you are first place in rank, you are rewarded more Scraps. So
          generally, build your score by doing stuff!<br /><br />
          You are given different amounts of XP for different actions:
        </p>
        <p class="green-highlight">
          Eliminating an Opponent - 1000xp<br />5 HP worth of Damage - 4xp
          (Continuous adding for each damage)<br />5 HP worth of Repair - 4xp
          (Continuous adding for each HP added)<br />5 flames extinguished - 4xp
          (Continuous adding for each flame)<br />Enemy Grappled - 100xp<br />Gadget
          Destroyed - 50px<br />Explosive Destroyed- 25xp<br />Enemy Flashed-
          25xp<br />Enemy Immobilized- 25xp<br />Spot Assist- 25xp<br />
        </p>
        <p>For Capture the Bases:</p>
        <p class="green-highlight">
          Captured Point - 750xp<br />Discovered Point - 500xp<br />Neutralized
          Point - 250xp<br />

        <h3 id="cannon"><br />Cannon Tank</h3>

        <h4>(Alias: Assault Tank, Default Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Cannon.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a cannon. It shoots high-power
          armor-piercing rounds. These rounds are based on impact damage,
          dealing a minimum of 75 HP and a maximum of 125 HP each round. The
          rate of fire is 60 rounds per minute. 12.5% of heat is added to the
          gun temperature after each round. The gun is highly accurate.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is an Artillery Strike.
          Once activated you have the ability to click on 6 points anywhere on
          your screen (You cannot place these points near respawn bases). The
          strike will not start unless all the points are activated. After all 6
          are selected, Artillery shells are fired from your base onto the
          coordinates. These shells have major explosive damage over a large
          area. Any tank directly on the fire of two of these shells will
          ultimately die. It takes 120 seconds to use this power up again.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is a Riot Shield. When
          activated, a shield emerges and protects the front and back of your
          tank. Your main weaponry is disabled. This shield protects you from
          all impact damage for up to 30 seconds. You can deactivate this
          ability at any time. It takes 15 to use this power up again. To
          control the direction of the shield, move your cursor towards to front
          or the back of the tank and the shield will move accordingly. (Be
          aware! Your sides can be exposed!)
        </p>
        <h5>
          The Riot Shield ability can be difficult to use, but if used
          correctly, it allows for a greater push for you and your teammates.
          Press your reverse key (Default is SHIFT), to reverse, allowing you
          tactically lose ground so your teammates can escape!
        </h5>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />Since it can be fairly difficult to get kills
          with only the main weapon, a natural ability is resetting the gun
          temperature after kills. This works for any type of kill, whether it
          be with the main cannon or your artillery strike. The gun temperature
          will be reset completely.
        </p>

        <h3 id="turret"><br />Turret Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Support Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Turret.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a machine gun. It shoots multiple
          rapid pellets in a short amount of time. These pellets deal small
          impact damage, decreasing a minimum of 5 HP and a maximum of 25 HP for
          each bullet. The rate of fire is 600 rounds per minute. 2.5% of heat
          is added to the gun temperature after each pellet is fired. The turret
          has a 15 degree spread, so stay in close range to your enemies.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is a Deflector Shield.
          Once activated, a two foldable shield flips up, attached to your
          nozzle. The side that is protected is the side where you point your
          nozzle, but you can still take damage if a projectile hits right in
          between the two parts of the shield. You are able to fire with this
          power up activated. Recharge time is 45 seconds. <br /><br />ABILITY
          #2:<br />The second ability is a Deployable Turret. When activated,
          you can click anywhere around you to set one turret. Once selected,
          the turret is ejected towards your select area. This turret will
          automatically shoot enemies nearby. If shot at or run over, the turret
          will be destroyed. It takes 75 seconds to use this power up again.
          <br /><br />PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />Your main weaponry has an automatic
          turret attached to it. This turret will shoot when enemies come close.
          It shoots with a fast rate of fire until eventually it has to reload.
          Reloading and firing is automatic.
        </p>
        <h5>
          This tank hails a bunch of firepower on the enemy. To get the most
          kills, activate both of your powerups simultaneously to get maximum
          damage!
        </h5>

        <h3 id="mechanic"><br />Mechanic Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Medic, Repair Tank, Mech)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Mech.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main tool is dual welding machine. It is
          mainly used to repair your fellow tanks, but it can also damage
          enemies if they come too close. You have to be within melee distance
          to repair or to damage. It repairs a minimum of 225 and maximum of 300
          hp per second. It damages a minimum of 225 hp and a maximum of 450 hp
          per second.
        </p>
        <h5>
          You can become unstoppable. Find a fellow mechanic and team up with
          them, healing your allies while healing each other. This diminishes
          incoming enemy fire!
        </h5>
        <p>
          ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is a Remote Controlled Bomb Car.
          Once activated, a RC car slides out of the back of your tank. You can
          control the car by holding the mouse down, making the car drive
          towards your mouse pointer. Once close to an enemy, you can blow up
          the car by holding the detonation key (Default is “X”). The detonation
          has a maximum damage of 735 hp, but keep in mind this is
          <a href="#basicgameplay"> explosion damage<sub>[6]</sub></a
          >. You have 30 seconds until the car will detonate. Once detonated,
          you have to wait 75 seconds until you can use this ability again.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is a Targeter Drone.
          When activated, a drone is deployed from the back of your tank. You
          can fly by pressing your mouse down, allowing the drone to move
          towards your mouse pointer. The drone can target enemy positions,
          pinging them to you and your allies. In order to ping someone, you
          must click on the enemy tank. It pings enemies for about 15 seconds
          before fading away. If the battery runs out, or you hold down the
          detonation key, the drone will fly back to your tank. Hold still to
          allow the drone to land.<br /><br />PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />Mechanics
          passive ability is self-repairment. This happens automatically,
          repairing 5 hp every second.
        </p>
        <h5>
          The mechanic has a reach over thin objects. This allows you to heal or
          damage players through some wooden or metal fences! So if you see an
          enemy who can't shoot you, you can still damage them if they get too
          close!

        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Sweeper.png" />
        <h4>(Alias: Multi, Shotgun Tank)</h4>
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a shotgun. It shoots 10 pellets at
          the same time. The spread of the pellets has an angled range of 25
          degrees. Each pellet deals a small amount of impact damage, decreasing
          a minimum of 5 HP and a maximum of 25 HP for each bullet. The rate of
          fire is 82 rpm, shooting 827 pellets per minute. 6% of heat is added
          to the gun temperature after each burst is fired. The turret has a 15
          degree spread, so stay within close range of your enemies.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is called “Shredder”
          for a good reason. It significantly increases your rate of fire. The
          rate of fire is 240 rpm, shooting 2400 pellets per minute. After you
          use the powerup, you have to wait 45 seconds in order to recharge it.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Even though you can fire faster with the Shredder ability, your gun
          cool still changes the same amount after each round. Make sure you
          spread out your shots or you might overheat your gun too quickly!
        </h5>
        <p>
          ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability causes the front of your tank to
          be spiked. This allows your tank to deal heavy damage if you collide
          with an enemy head on. This is great for clearing areas. You can use
          this ability for 30 seconds before the spikes retract. After the
          ability is used, you have to wait 60 seconds before using it again.
          <br /><br />PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />You are more resistant to
          <a href="#sniper">Sniper’s Flashbang<sub>[21]</sub></a> and
          <a href="#railgun">Railgun’s Immobilizer<sub>[21]</sub></a
          >. The disorienting effects last shorter than any other tank. This
          allows you to get back into the battle quicker.

        <h3 id="missile"><br />Missle Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Silo Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Silo.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main weapon is a guided missile. It fires a
          missile, guided by your mouse pointer. Once the missile contacts any
          enemy tank or object, the missile will explode with huge impact
          damage, dealing a minimum of 650 HP and a maximum of 750 HP. The
          reload time is based on the gun cool, because once fired, the gun cool
          reaches its maximum. This is a ranged weapon, and it takes space to
          fire accurately. Do not put the back of your nozzle facing the wall
          when firing; the missile will explode. <br /><br />ABILITY #1:<br />The
          first ability is Swarm. Once activated, multiple mini missiles will
          deploy, actively auto-guiding towards the nearest enemy. You cannot
          guide these missiles. It takes a bunch of space to fire the Swarm as
          it spreads out from the back of your tank. Have at least four
          tank-lengths of distance from the back of your tank to the nearest
          object; Otherwise, some of the guided missiles will explode. It takes
          75 seconds to use the power up again.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Since the Swarm projectiles are activated from the back of the tank,
          face the bank of your tank towards the enemy. This will give the
          missiles more range and velocity against the enemy.
        </h5>
        <p>
          ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is HELIOS defense (High Energy
          Laser with Integrated Optical-Dazzler and Surveillance). Once
          activated, this device begins to search and burn any nearby moving
          electronics, from enemy <a href="#scout">UAVs<sub>[19]</sub></a> to
          <a href="#mechanic">Drones<sub>[12]</sub></a> and even enemy guided
          missiles. It is also a direct counter to the Swarm. Any enemy
          projectile or gadget that can be moved by the user can be shot down by
          the HELIOS defense system. You cannot control this device; it locks on
          to the nearest enemy gadget. It takes 30 seconds to regenerate this
          powerup. <br /><br />PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />This tank’s passive ability
          is the Early Warning System. It pings any set-down enemy gadget
          ranging from <a href="#demolition">Mines<sub>[19]</sub></a> to
          <a href="#turret">Turrets<sub>[19]</sub></a
          >. Only you can see this ping. The ping is a blue target that turns
          into an arrow if you are a distance away from it. In order for this
          ping to activate you have to find the gadget.

        <h4>(Alias: Double, Akimbo Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Dual.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main weapon is two cannons. It fires
          high-impact armor-piercing rounds, at a faster rate than
          <a href="#cannon">Cannon Tank<sub>[10]</sub></a
          >. The rate of fire is 100 rounds per minute. Each projectile deals a
          minimum of 75 HP and a maximum of 125 HP. It increases the gun cool by
          12.5%.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Although the main cannons fire accurately, the left gun is aiming
          slightly left of your cursor, and the right is aiming slightly right.
          Don’t expect the projectile to hit exactly on your cursor! Make sure
          each cannon cursor icon is aiming at the target.
        </h5>
        <p>
          ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability doubles your fire rate. Once
          activated you have the ability to fire 16 shots 200 rounds per minute.
          After 16 projectiles are fired, the ability is deactivated. You will
          have to wait 45 seconds until you can use this powerup again.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is a Trophy System.
          When activated, you can click anywhere around you to set one trophy
          system. Once selected, the system flings towards your select area.
          This turret will disable any explosive ordinances within 2.5
          tank-lengths. The trophy system can only handle 200 HP worth of damage
          before being disabled. It takes 75 seconds to use this power up again.
          <br /><br />PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />Since this is relatively a bigger
          tank, it has 125 more HP, having a total of 1125 HP.
        </p>

        <h3 id="heavy"><br />Heavy Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Tubby (or Tub) Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Heavy.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main weapon is a heavy machine gun. It fires
          armor piercing rounds at a high rate of fire; 333 rounds per minute.
          Each projectile deals a minimum of 20 HP and a maximum of 50 HP. The
          machine gun has a 8 degree spread, categorizing this as a medium range
          tank. Each time a projectile is fired it adds 4.5% to the gun cool.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is flak armor. Once
          activated, all types of damage are reduced by 50% for 30 seconds,
          requiring the enemy to use double the effort to destroy you. Once your
          30 seconds is up, it takes 30 seconds for you to use the ability
          again. <br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is a Grenade
          Launcher. When activated, you can fire 10 explosive rounds with your
          aim button (Default is Right Mouse Button). Each explosive round does
          an impact damage of 50 to 100 HP. On impacts, or hits the ground due
          to range, it explodes with a maximum area damage of 450 HP within a
          radius of 1.75 tank-lengths. This round can fire over walls, but you
          need to back up at least 3 tank-lengths away from the wall. This
          projectile has a range of 12 tank-lengths. Once you used up the 10
          rounds, you have to wait 60 seconds until you can use the ability
          again.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Since the Grenade Launcher requires you to press the aim button to
          launch, fire the explosive rounds only when there is multiple targets
          that are in range of the Grenade Launcher. Fire normally if the
          enemies are too close or too far! You can fire both your main weapon
          and the grenade launcher at the same time to maximize your damage.
          (Also, Grenade Launchers do not affect your gun cool)!
        </h5>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />If your enemy unfortunately defeats you, you
          will explode. This explosion has a maximum area damage of 900 HP
          within a radius of 2.5 tank-lengths. If you are about to die, charge
          towards your enemy to have the last laugh. Take them down with you.
        </p>

        <h3 id="minigun"><br />Minigun Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Mini Tank, Speeder, Rally Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Mini.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a rapid gatling gun. It shoots
          multiple rapid pellets in a very, very short amount of time. These
          pellets deal very small impact damage, decreasing a minimum of 5 HP
          and a maximum of 10 HP for each bullet. The rate of fire is 2000
          rounds per minute! To combat this insane fire rate, it takes about a
          second to charge up the gun, which you can do either by holding fire
          or aiming (aim button does not fire, it only charges the gun). 1.15%
          of heat is added to the gun temp after each pellet is fired. The
          minigun has a 4 degree spread, allowing for almost direct aiming.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is a NOS boost. Once
          activated, your tank moves 4.65 tank-lengths per second (rather than
          the original 3 tank-lengths per second). This is a 55% increase,
          allowing you to move faster for 15 seconds. After the 15 seconds is
          up, you have to wait 30 seconds in order to activate the NOS again.
          <br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is a Grappling Hook.
          When activated, you can click anywhere around you to set a trap. Once
          selected, the trap flings towards your select area. If an enemy drives
          over the hook of the trap, the hook will hold the enemy in place for
          30 seconds. The enemy is only allowed to move within a radius of 2.5
          tank-lengths around the trap. If no enemy is trapped, the trap will
          wait 60 seconds before dismantling. It takes 45 seconds to recharge
          this ability.
        </p>

        <h5>
          With the Grappling Hook ready, aim ahead of the enemy to grab the
          enemy. Then circle around them with NOS while firing to defeat them.
          It’s best to use this ability as a weapon rather than a trap to ensure
          their deaths!
        </h5>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />Other tanks rotate their turrets 180 degrees per
          second, but the Minigun’s turret moves 240 degrees per second. This
          allows you to snap towards enemy positions with ease.

        <h3 id="napalm"><br />Napalm Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Pyro Tank, Flame Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Napalm.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is an armor-piercing incendiary
          cannon. The projectile deals a minimum of 50 HP and a maximum of 100
          HP, but once impacted, the projectile bursts into flames, which causes
          <a href="#gameplay">Continuous Damage<sub>[6]</sub></a
          >. The rate of fire is 150 rounds per minute. 17% of heat is added to
          the gun temp after each projectile is fired. The cannon has a 10
          degree spread. The incendiary round has a range of 5 tank-lengths and
          will ultimately burst into flames if nothing is impacted. So stay in
          close contact with your enemies! <br /><br />ABILITY #1:<br />The
          first ability is a Flamethrower. Once activated, you can shoot flames
          for a maximum of 30 seconds. These flames are thrown within a range of
          3 tank-lengths. These flames cause Continuous damage, and will
          immediately catch their enemy tank on fire. <br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The
          second ability is a Fire Extinguisher. Once activated, you can
          extinguish fires for a maximum of 30 seconds. These particles are
          thrown within a range of 5 tank-lengths. If friendlies are on fire,
          this Extinguisher can almost immediately extinguish them. You can also
          extinguish kerosene on fire as well. Be careful, you can also
          extinguish enemy tanks on fire as well!
        </p>

        <h5>
          You can disable the first and second ability at any time, and you only
          have to wait double the amount of time you used it for! For example,
          if you use the Flamethrower for 5 seconds, you only have to wait 10
          seconds to reactivate it again.
        </h5>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />This tank is completely fireproof, so you are
          not affected by enemy flames. This will make it tough to defeat enemy
          Pyro tanks.

        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Scout.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a semi-automatic gun. It shoots
          high-velocity tracer rounds. These rounds deal a minimum of 20 HP and
          a maximum of 40 HP each round. Once impacted, the enemy is pinged for
          5 seconds to all of your teammates. The rate of fire is a max 340
          rounds per minute. You are required to press your fire button again to
          fire another projectile. 8% of heat is added to the gun temperature
          after each round. The gun is highly accurate. <br /><br />ABILITY
          #1:<br />The first ability is Thermal. Once activated, you have the
          ability to see through objects and even invisible snipers! Tanks
          hidden through smoke or under trees are easily seen with this ability.
          The Thermal lasts for 30 seconds, and it takes an additional 30
          seconds to use it again.<br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second
          ability is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Once clicked, your view is
          transported to a UAV which is controlled by your mouse pointer. The
          UAV can shoot 1200 rounds per minute. Each projectile deals a minimum
          of 20 HP and a maximum of 50 HP. The drone will automatically ping any
          nearby enemies. This UAV can fly for up to 60 seconds. Beware of
          <a href="#missile">Missile Tanks<sub>[14]</sub></a> because the UAV
          can be easily burn down by the HELIOS laser. It takes 75 seconds to
          use this power up again.
        </p>
        <h5>
          The UAV will take your attention away from your tank! So make sure
          your tank is in a safe space or you might be attacked without you
          knowing. It's best if you stay in your main base when activating the
          UAV!
        </h5>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />The range you can see is doubled the normal
          amount, allowing you to see enemies before they can see you. This
          means that the farther your cursor is, the farther you can see.

        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Recon.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main guns are two HMGs. The guns are located
          at each end of the tank, shooting at the same time. Both shoot
          high-velocity rounds, each round dealing a minimum of 12.5 HP and a
          maximum of 23.75 HP each round. The rate of fire for each gun is 400
          rounds per minute. 6% of heat is added to the gun temperature after
          both guns are fired.
        </p>
        <h5>
          If you are surrounded by enemies, aim at the center of your tank to
          shoot both forwards and backwards. Each gun points at your cursor, so
          the bottom gun will point up while the top shoots down.
        </h5>
        <p>
          ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is an Airstrike. Once activated,
          you have the ability to select any position around you. Once selected,
          a red airstrike ping (visible to everyone) is shown for 7.5 seconds
          before the jets arrive. This allows time for you to escape. Once the
          two jets arrive in the direction you point your nozzle, any tank in
          the area will die. Each jet releases 30 bombs across the surface, and
          each bomb has an area damage of 640 HP within a radius of 2.5
          tank-lengths. That is 60 bombs totaling to a maximum damage of 38400
          HP! Because of the chaos this ensues, this can only be called once
          every 120 seconds.<br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is a
          move marker. Once activated, you have the ability to select any
          position around you. Once selected, a yellow ping (visible to only
          your team) is shown for 30 seconds. Any enemy within that area is
          pinged. It takes 45 to use this power up again.
        </p>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />The distance you can see is 125% the normal
          zoom, allowing you to see enemies before they can see you. This allows
          the Recon Tank to attack/ping the tank from a distance because the
          view is more zoomed out.

        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a heavy single-fire sniper. The
          weapon shoots the highest velocity projectile of any tank. Each round
          deals a minimum of 300 HP and a maximum of 425 HP each round. You have
          to wait three seconds before firing again. 60% of heat is added to the
          gun temperature after each fire. The projectile is extremely accurate
          and very fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is an Invisible Cloak. Once
          activated, you are not visible to your enemies. Only you, your allies,
          and <a href="#scout">Scout's Thermal<sub>[19]</sub></a> can see you at
          50% opacity. The cloak is active for 30 seconds, and can be used again
          after another 30 seconds. However, if you fire your weapon, the cloak
          immediately disappears and the ability ends.

          If an enemy Sniper tank is damaged, their smoke is visible even when
          they are cloaked. Look for floating smoke particles: it could be an
          invisible sniper!
        </h5>
        <p>
          ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability is a flashbang. Once activated,
          you have the ability to select any position around you. Once selected,
          a flashbang is flinged, blinding your enemies for a maximum of 7.5
          seconds. It deals a maximum area damage of 50 HP within a radius of 3
          tank-lengths. It takes 60 seconds to use this ability again.
        </p>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />This tank is more silent (half the engine sound)
          than any other tank. The detectability is also halved, so if you are
          pinged by an enemy, it takes 50% less time to disappear. Also, if you
          press your aim button, it increases your view range by a factor of 6.

        <h3 id="railgun"><br />Railgun Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Pincer)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Railgun.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is an extremely high-powered
          single-shot energy weapon. Each round deals a minimum of 500 HP and a
          maximum of 700 HP each round. To combat this damage, it takes about a
          second to charge up the gun, which you can do either by holding fire
          or aiming (aim button does not fire, it only charges the gun). The
          reload time is based on the gun cool, because once fired, the gun cool
          reaches maximum. The projectile is extremely accurate and very fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability is a high-powered Laser. Once
          activated, you can shoot a laser that deals high
          <a href="#gameplay">Continuous Damage<sub>[6]</sub></a
          >. The laser has a range of 10 tank-lengths, allowing you to reach
          your enemies with ease. To combat the damage and range, it takes about
          a second to charge up the gun. You can use this for 30 seconds, and it
          takes 75 seconds to use this again.<br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The
          second ability is a Movement Immobilizer. Once activated, you have the
          ability to select any position around you. Once selected, an ordinance
          is launched, disabling your enemies’ movement for 7.5 seconds. It
          deals a maximum area damage of 50 HP within a radius of 3
          tank-lengths. It takes 45 seconds to use this ability again. You are
          not affected by your own Immobilizer.
        </p>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />If your health is greater than 200 HP, and you
          are not moving, you have zero recoil. This means your tank will not
          move if fired.
        </p>

        <h3 id="demolition"><br />Demolition Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Demo, Mine Tank, Explosive Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Mine.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a highly-explosive grenade
          launcher. Each round deals impact damage, with a minimum of 20 HP and
          a maximum of 50 HP. Each round also explodes, with a maximum area
          damage of 350 HP within a radius of 1.75 tank-lengths. The rate of
          fire is 240 rounds per minute. 17% of heat is added to the gun cool.
          The spread of the weapon is 10 degrees. The range of the projectile is
          6 tank-lengths, making this a medium ranged tank.
        </p>
        <p>
          ABILITY #1:<br />The first ability allows you to place mines. Once
          activated, you can place mines directly beneath your tank that will
          only explode if an enemy touches it. Each mine adds 15 seconds to the
          powerup’s rechargeability. This means that if you only place three
          mines out of the maximum 5 mines, and deactivate the ability, you only
          have to wait 45 seconds. You have to wait a maximum of 75 seconds to
          use the ability again.<br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second ability
          is a C4 Sticky Bomb. Once activated, you have the ability to select
          any position around you. Once selected, a C4 sticky bomb is flinged,
          sticking to any surface (including tanks)! Your view is transported to
          the bomb. You can explode it any time by holding the detonate button.
          If you do nothing with the bomb, the C4 will automatically explode
          after 30 seconds. The detonation causes a maximum area damage of 1200
          HP within a radius of 3 tank-lengths. It takes 75 seconds to use this
          ability again.
        </p>
        <h5>
          If you attach your C4 Sticky Bomb to an enemy, wait until they are
          close to other enemies to deal the most damage! If you see a friendly
          tank stuck with a C4, drive away from them fast!
        </h5>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />This tank is explosion resistant. If this tank
          is in an explosion, the area damage is halved. This means that it
          might be difficult to kill enemy Mine Tanks!
        </p>

        <h3 id="corrosive"><br />Corrosive Tank</h3>
        <h4>(Alias: Gas Tank, Smoke Tank)</h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="HTML_images\Guide_Html\Smoke.png" />
        <p>
          MAIN WEAPONRY:<br />The main gun is a Corrosive Thrower. It sprays a
          large amount of corrosive gas within 4 tank-lengths. Each gas particle
          deals <a href="#gameplay">Continuous Damage<sub>[6]</sub></a
          >. 30% of heat is added to the gun cool every second. The spread of
          the weapon is 15 degrees, making this a short ranged tank.
        </p>
        <p>
          ABILITY #1:<br />The second ability is a Smoke Screen. Once activated,
          smoke will expand from your tank. Move around to spread the smoke out.
          This helps cover your allies and can confuse the enemy. It sprays
          smoke for 7.5 seconds, and lasts for 25 seconds. It takes 30 seconds
          to recharge this ability.<br /><br />ABILITY #2:<br />The second
          ability allows you to place gas mines. Once activated, you can place
          mines directly beneath your tank that will only release gas if an
          enemy is near it (or enemy shoots it). Each gas particle does major
          Continuous Damage. Each mine adds 20 seconds to the powerup’s
          rechargeability. This means that if you only place one mine out of the
          maximum 3 mines, and deactivate the ability, you only have to wait 20
          seconds. You have to wait a maximum of 60 seconds to use the ability
          again. A gas mine has 400 HP, so if shot to an extent, it will
          disappear.
        </p>
        <h5>
          To escape, use both of the abilities at the same time! Not only will
          they be blinded by the smoke, but they won't realize the position of
          the gas mines! This also means they can’t chase you in a straight
          line!
        </h5>
        <p>
          PASSIVE ABILITY:<br />This tank can see through smoke! So if your
          enemies are blinded by smoke, attack them! They won’t know where to
          shoot!
        </p>

        <h3 id="teamdeathmatch"><br />Team Deathmatch</h3>
        <p>
          Team Deathmatch is a classic gamemode with the usual rules. There are
          two teams, Team Green and Team Orange. Both teams are trying to
          destroy as many opposing enemies as possible. Each kill adds a point
          to the team’s score. The team with the greatest score by the time the
          clock hits zero wins.ADD UI INFO?
        </p>

        <h4 id="capturethebases"><br />Capture The Bases</h4>
        <p>
          Capture the Bases is another classic gamemode. Like Team Deathmatch,
          there are two teams, Team Green and Team Orange. In this gamemode,
          both teams are trying to capture as many bases as possible. There are
          5 Bases, named A through E. At the very start of the match, all bases
          are neutral. If you and your allies pile onto a base, the flag starts
          to turn your team’s color. After capturing it, points are added
          consistently to the team score until the enemy captures it. The team
          with the greatest score by the time the clock hits zero wins.ADD UI
          INFO?
        </p>

        <h4 id="miniarena"><br />Mini Arena</h4>
        <p>
          Mini Arena is a gamemode with no teams. All players are against each
          other, trying to get the most kills. Each kill adds a point to the
          player's overall score. The player with the most kills by the time the
          clock hits zero wins. ADD UI INFO?
        </p>

        <h4 id="zombies"><br />Zombies</h4>
        <p>
          Zombies is a co-op mode with up to 10 players. There are infinite
          amounts of rounds, so the game ends when everyone dies (The Zombies
          always win 😭). Each round gets progressively harder, with new types
          of zombies appearing in some levels. Players try to kill as many
          zombies as possible before they are destroyed. There are no abilities
          (instead of passive ones). If players survive a round, all destroyed
          players can respawn before the next round starts.
        </p>

        <h3 id="maps"><br />Maps</h3>
        <p>
          Each game can be played on different maps. The classic Grasslands map
          is always selected as default. Each map has its own properties and
          various objects.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Each map is unique! If you save enough scraps, you can buy camos to
          match the maps!
        </h5>
        <img class="imageMain" src="HTML_images\grasslands.png" />
        <p>
          The first map is called Grasslands. This classic green landscape is
          uncrowded, filled with scattered trees and rocks. It has various
          static and interactive objects.<br /><br />Static objects include:
          <br />- Common Trees <br />- Rocks <br />- Walls <br />- Flowers
          <br />- Logs <br /><br />Interactive objects include: <br />- Kerosene
          Drums <br />
          As the name implies, the Grasslands are trying to depict the average
          setting of temperamental forests. This simple map makes it easy for
          close to far range combat.<br /><br />
          <img class="imageMain" src="HTML_images\mudlands.png" />
          The next map is called Mudlands. This brown and muddy landscape is
          interspersed with hay bales and farms. It has various static and
          interactive objects, similar to those of the Grasslands.<br /><br />Static
          objects include: <br />- Common Trees <br />- Hay Bales <br />- Fences
          <br />- Flowers <br /><br />Interactive objects include: <br />-
          Kerosene Drums <br />- Junk Cars <br />
          The Mudlands is depicted as a farm/junk yard with a few trees. On the
          other hand, multiple segments of fences makes this map a little
          difficult to attack others from far distances. This map is built for
          short to mid range combat.<br /><br />
          <img class="imageMain" src="HTML_images\desert.png" />
          The following map is called Desert. Unlike the Mudlands, this dusty
          landscape is barely filled with any objects. It has a few static and
          interactive objects.<br /><br />Static objects include: <br />- Palm
          Trees <br />- Rocks <br />- Desert Walls <br /><br />Interactive
          objects include: <br />- Kerosene Drums <br />
          The Desert is depicted as an empty battle ground with small cover. The
          little objects in this map makes defending very difficult. This map is
          built for mid to far range combat.<br /><br />
          <img class="imageMain" src="HTML_images\tropical.png" />
          The next map is called Tropical. This compact jungle is filled with
          multiple objects. It has various static and interactive objects.<br /><br />Static
          objects include: <br />- Palm Trees <br />- Rocks <br />- Jungle Walls
          <br />- Bamboo Stacks <br />- Bamboo trees <br />- Flowers
          <br /><br />Interactive objects include: <br />- Kerosene Drums <br />
          Tropical is depicted as a small and dense jungle. The amount of trees
          and walls in this map makes finding and attacking contacts somewhat
          difficult. This map is built for short to mid range combat.<br /><br />
          <img class="imageMain" src="HTML_images\shipyard.png" />
          The following map is called Shipyard. Just like the Tropical map, this
          compact map is filled with multiple objects. It has various static and
          interactive objects.<br /><br />Static objects include: <br />-
          Shipping Containers <br />- Parking Lots <br />- Garbage Disposals
          <br />- AC Units <br />- Watch Towers <br /><br />Interactive objects
          include: <br />- Kerosene Drums <br />- Forklifts <br />
          The Shipyard is depicted as a small and compact Shipping yard. The
          amount of containers in this map makes navigating and attacking
          contacts difficult. The map is also surrounded by water, which acts as
          a boundary while making the map smaller. This map is built for short
          range combat.<br /><br />
          <img class="imageMain" src="HTML_images\Nighttime.png" />
          The last map is called Nighttime. This map is almost exactly the same
          map as Grasslands, but it takes place at Night. It has various static
          and interactive objects.<br /><br />Static objects include: <br />-
          Common Trees <br />- Rocks <br />- Walls <br />- Flowers <br />- Logs
          <br /><br />Interactive objects include: <br />- Kerosene Drums <br />
          As the name implies, Nighttime is depicted as the average setting of
          temperamental forests during the night. This dark environment makes it
          difficult to detect enemies from far ranges. Because of this, this map
          is built for close to mid range combat.<br /><br />
          <img class="imageMain" src="HTML_images\dead terror.png" />
          There is also a map specifically designed for Zombies. This map is
          called Dead Terror. This map is small. It has various static and
          interactive objects.<br /><br />Static objects include: <br />- Rocks
          <br />- Crumbling Walls <br />- Fences <br />- Logs
          <br /><br />Interactive objects include: <br />- Kerosene Drums
          <br />- Junk Cars <br /><br />
          As the name implies, Dead Terror is depicted as a horror setting of
          the dead. This map is built for close to mid range combat against the
          zombies.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h4 id="fob"><br />Forward Operating Base</h4>
        <p>
          Each team has a FOB. This is the general respawn point if you are
          destroyed. Although it is mainly considered the respawn point, it also
          contains various objects that help assist the players as needed.
          First, let’s get the static objects out of the way. <br />- AC Units
          and Tents were built sleeping and recreational areas for your Tank’s
          crew. <br />- Garbage Disposals <br />- Shipping Containers <br />-
          Watch Towers <br /><br />These objects are placed inside the walls of
          the base. All of these objects have no function. However, there are
          key interactive objects that can assist you in the base. <br />-
          Airport and Runway. These are built for
          <a href="#scout">Scout's UAVs<sub>[19]</sub></a> which takeoff from
          here. <br />- Artillery Pieces. Three artilleries were built to server
          <a href="#cannon">Cannon's<sub>[10]</sub></a> purposes. Each artillery
          projectile is fired from here. <br />- Repair Stations. These green
          shipping containers rapidly decrease gun temperature and increase
          integrity.
        </p>

        <h5>
          Repair Stations were built to help combat spawn camping. If you are
          ever spawn camped, sit on the repair station and shoot the enemy.
        </h5>
        <br />- Kerosene Drums<br /><br />Finally, the last object of the FOB
        are the gates. The gates are used to keep players in before the match
        starts. When the admins start the match the gates of the FOB will open.
        <h3 id="se"><br />Server Errors</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, you might be forcefully ejected from a server or game.
          If you hadn’t left the game on your own volition, an error has
          occurred. This error will be promptly shown on the main page. If you
          don’t understand the error, below is a list of errors and their
          definitions.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: a1 key doesn’t exist</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when you have entered a game with no a1 key. This
          a1 key stores all the server parameters and rules, so without this, no
          game can run. This error might occur when there is a sudden loss of
          connection or if the a1 key is tampered with.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: AT values not set</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when the game cannot find the host’s list of
          banned tanks. This error might occur when a mod/third-party developer
          hosts a game where all tanks are banned.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: invalid mapsize</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when the game cannot recognize the size of the
          map. This error might occur when the a1 key is tampered with or if a
          mod/third-party developer sets the map size to less than 1000 pixels
          subsequent with an incorrect gamemode.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: is host/supposed to be peer</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when you enter a game where the host is not
          present. This error might occur when the a1 key is tampered with or if
          you joined a game exactly when the host leaves.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: is peer/supposed to be host</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when you host a game but you are set as a peer.
          This error will occur when the a1 key is tampered with. If you are a
          mod/third-party developer, disable this error validator or it might be
          difficult to develop your changes.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: tampered seed</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when you enter a game where the host hands you a
          manipulated map generator code (seed).
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: Disconnected from Signaling Server</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when you are forcefully disconnected from the
          server. This error might occur when connectivity is interrupted or the
          server detects you as a threat/virus.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: Corrupted server signal</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when the signaling server goes down or there was a
          miscellaneous error between you and the signaling server.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: a1 key error (200, 201, 202…386)</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error will occur when the a1 key is tampered with. This error
          will most likely pop up for mods/third-party developers who tamper
          with the a1 key decoder or the a1 key itself.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: host new game not detected</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when you cannot detect the next round. This error
          will most likely occur after the round is over and the host leaves.
        </p>

        <h6>[X] Error: Leave reason not defined</h6>
        <p class="explainedError">
          This error is shown when you have entered a game with no leave reason
          key. This key stores all of the above errors or any other reason the
