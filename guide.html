        <h4 id="history"><br />History and Origins</h4>
        <p>
          The first version of this game started on MIT's Scratch, created by
          the user Rboombox. This version has only campaign missions; there is
          no multiplayer mode available. Being the basis of Tackle Tanks, there
          are no abilities or powerups in this version. The game is still
          playable as of now.
          <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/553792334/"
            >Click here to play this version!</a
          >
        </p>
        <img class="imageLeft" src="HTML_images/Guide_Html/ttiov1.png" />
        <p>
          Rboombox, inspired by other .io games on the internet, decided to use
          the idea of his scratch project and create TackleTanks.io. This game
          was created using Javascript, HTML5, and CSS. Version 1 was completed
          November 2022. This multiplayer version contained multiple updates,
          such as two abilities for each tank (some powerups are the same with
          this version). There were also updated guns and machinery, updated
          maps and objects, and the implemation of shop. This version of Tackle
          Tanks could be played anywehre on the web.
        </p>
        <h5>
          This version is no longer availiable. Older versions of Tackle Tanks
          are overwritten by the newest version.
        </h5>
        <p>
          In this new update -- Tackle Tanks v2 as of January 2024 -- there are
          major improvements. Most of the art and style of the game is upgraded,
          as well as the abilities and weaponary of each tanks. The main problem
          of the old version was how laggy and slow it ran. This version runs
          smoother and can handle more objects!
        </p>

        <p>
          Other updates include: new gamemodes, more skins, upgraded scoring
          system, better effects and particles, better options/settings, ect.
          This game guide is another advancement as well. If you are trying to
          find any information about how something works, search it up in this

        <p>
          Since we are all for transparency, you can see all of the scripts and
          programs that will run on your browser as you're playing the game. To
          check this out,
          <a href="https://github.com/LeeechLabStudios/Tackle-Tanks"
            >click this link</a
          >. This is posted on Github.<br /><br />
          If you find errors/bugs or you have a suggestion for the game, submit
          a statement in the Issue category. You'll have to create an account in
          order to do this.<br /><br />
          We do not care if you try to make a modded game. Some of the scripts
          that runs the server connection, like
          <a
            href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeeechLabStudios/Tackle-Tanks/gh-pages/scripts/c3runtime.js"
            >c3runtime.js</a
          >, may help you in your journey. We don't know how you'll accomplish
          this, but remember that we do not have any part of your creations.
          Maybe in the future we will create a program to assist in creating
          mods (This hasn't change as of right now). If you are successful
          creating a modded server, we encorage you to share how you did this
          with the world.
        </p>
        <h3 id="serverOptions"><br />Server Options</h3>
        <p>
          This section of the guide will recapuliate each function of a server.
          In order to join a game, click play, scroll through the game list, and
          then join the game. In order to host a game, click play and then host
          a game. This will lead you to a page of game options, titled "Host A
          Game". Make sure your device can handle multiple calculations and
          rendering if you do this. Low-end processers may result in lag for you
          and your players. Also, to clarify most misconceptions, hosting a
          server is FREE.<br /><br />
          The first thing that appears is the map options. In order to change
          how people can select the next map, select "Change of Map". "Map vote"
          means that after a game, your players can vote on the next map (this
          poll is open for 30 seconds). Random means that the next map will be
          arbitrary. The rest of the options means that the map is always
          constant (Ex: If you select "Grasslands Only", the map will stay as
          Grasslands until the host leaves). If you select these options, you
          will not be able to change the "Starting Map". Otherwise, if you click
          "Starting Map", this will change the first map in your game.
          <br /><br />In order to change the size of the field, click on "Map
          Size". The options, Small, Medium, and Large, are exactly what they
          represent.
        </p>
        <h5>
          IMPORTANT: Some server options may be immutable based on certain
          gamemodes! (Ex: If the gamemode "RC Race" is selected, the amount of
          players will change. If the gamemode "Mini Arena" is selected, the map
          size will change to Mini). Check out each gamemodes to see every
          limitation!
        </h5>
        <p>
          After the map segment there is a "Gamemode" segment. There are only
          two options you can change here. The first option will change the
          actual objectives and style of the game. To see each gamemode and
          their rules, go to the
          <a href="#teamdeathmatch">Gamemode<sub>[25]</sub></a>
          guide.<br /><br />The next option is "Time Limit". Exactly as it's
          written, this represents the amount of time for each round. The
          default is 15 minutes, but the maximum amount is an hour (the minimum:
          1 minute).<br /><br />The next segment is the "Tank" category. The
          first option changes the number of players PER TEAM. This said, if the
          number of players per team is 50, a maximum of 100 players can join
          your server because there are two teams. The next option is titled
          "Select your tank". It can ethier be disabled or enabled. Disabling
          this will result in players receiving a randomly selected tank. If
          enabled, players can choose their tank. They can only do this each
          round though, changing the tank is not allowed during the match.<br /><br />After
          this, there is an option to desgniate what tanks are allowed in your
          game (Titled, "Allowed Tanks"). By default, all of the tanks are
          selected. You can unselect a tank be clicking on it, changing the
          color to be gray. Gray obviously means it's unselected. If you think a
          tank will not suit your needs, unselect it. At least one tank should
          be selected.<br /><br />The last option is "Automated Bots". You can
          enable/disable if your game has bots. A bot will be destroyed after a
          player has joined. If a player leaves, a bot will be created. Bots
          will also even out a team. If disabled, there will be no bots at
          all.<br /><br />The very last segment is the "Advanced" section. The
          first option is "Dedicated Server". This implies that, if enabled,
          when you host the game, the game will automatically run until you end
          it by clicking "End Server". In basic terms, if your computer is left
          on for 24/7, your game will stay up and running. Even though it is
          healthy for your computer to run 24/7, this may affect your internet
          usage. Check your internet provider to see if running this will stay
          in your price range. Otherwise, just disable this. It's really
          unnecessary, but it's an option you can select.<br /><br />Lastly, the
          final option for hosting the game is the "Public/Private Game"
          selection. If public, anybody can find your game and join it. If
          private, the only way to enter the game is if you have a code or url.
          If you select "Private", invite all your friends by sending them the
          link.<br /><br />After you decided on all of these options, tap "Host
          Game", and the server will start. Remember that creating a server will
          run programs, manifesting multiple calculations every second. This
          game is designed for average computers, so even though you might not
          have the best PC, you can still make a game and play with your
          friends.
        </p>
        <h4 id="settings"><br />Settings and Each Function</h4>
        <p>
          Just like the "Server Options" part above, this is a recapulation of
          each Settings. To change how your game works in Settings, click the
          setting symbol located on the top right corner of the home page. This
          will bring you to a page labeled "Settings". There are a number of
          settings to change, so modify each option to create the best gameplay
          possible.<br /><br />The first segment on this page is titled
          "Gameplay". The first option enables or disables Screen Shake. As the
          name implies, your screen will shake or rumble when you are near an
          explosion (Ex: Let's say you are underneath an airstrike. Your screen
          will shake like crazy!). Disable it in order to get rid of this. The
          next option is titled "Dim Flashbang". When you are flashbanged by a
          <a href="#sniper">Sniper<sub>[21]</sub></a
          >, your whole screen turns stark white. This might result in temporary
          blindness and damage to the retinas if you are playing in a dark room.
          When you enable "Dim Flashbang" this will change the flashbanged
          effect to become black instead of white, saving your eyes!<br /><br />The
          next option is "Anonymized Usernames". As the name implies, you will
          play against friendly default names (Ex: "BraveOperator", or
          "UsefulTank"). This will aslo disable kill feed. This is automatically
          set to disabled, so you might see inappropriate names. The final
          option for the Gameplay section is "SFX Volume". This changes the
          volume for all sounds in the game.<br /><br />
          The next section is titled "Key Bindings". To change a key for any
          action, click on the action's button and press a key. If you press the
          escape key or a key that already exists for another action, the key
          will not change. You cannot set the keybinds to Escape or the Arrow
          keys.<br /><br />The first four keybinds of the settings is "Move Up",
          "Left", "Right", and "Down". The WASD keys are the defualted for the
          movement of your tank. Also, the arrow keys are constant for moving
          the tank. So regardless of what keybinds you use for movment, you can
          always rely on moving your tank with the arrow key pad.<br /><br />The
          next keybind is "Alternate Shooting". The name implies that there is a
          main button used for shooting. This is the left mouse button, which is
          constant. Some tank' powerups (Like
          <a href="#heavy">Heavy's<sub>[16]</sub></a> Grenade Laucnher) or main
          gun (Like <a href="#Snipers">Sniper's<sub>[21]</sub></a> gun) allows
          you to aim when you click the right mouse button. This is constant as
          well.<br /><br />
          The next button is "Reverse". This button, when held, will move the
          tank backwards. So if you move your tank and press the reverse key,
          you still move in the correct direction, it is just the back of your
          tank that faces the direction. This is helpful in some cases,
          especially for <a href="#cannon">Cannon's<sub>[10]</sub></a> Riot
          Sheild ability. The default for this key is Shift.<br /><br />The next
          to keybindings you can edit is "Activate Left or Right Ability".
          Naturally Q and E, these button activates the ability your tank has.
          If you activated the ability, and press the same key again, it
          deactivates the ability. Deactivating before the main cooldown of that
          ability may result in less cooldown.<br /><br />The next ability is
          "Detonate", which is defaulted to the X key. This is meant for certain
          gadgets your tank might have. For instance if you are a
          <a href="#mechanic">Mechanic<sub>[12]</sub></a> tank and you activate
          your RC Car ability, you can explode your car early by holding the
          detonate key.<br /><br />The next bind you can edit is the "Show/Hide
          Chat" key. This key, as implied, shows or hides the chat if clicked,
          and the default is T. To add on to that, the next keybind allows you
          to chat. This key is naturally ENTER. In order to actually message
          people, you first tap this key, then type whatever message, and then
          press ENTER. Regardless of what key you set this to, ENTER will
          ultimately send the message.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Messaging in Chat is global! There is no team chat. Make sure you
          don't inform the enemy about your whereabouts.
        </h5>
        <p>
          The last keybind is "Show/Hide Scoreboard and Menu". As the name
          implies, this key when clicked will show the scoreboard and other menu
          options. This key by default is TAB.<br /><br />Finally, the last
          section in the Settings page is "Advanced". Here, there are some
          settings people normally don't look for. The first option is to show
          FPS and Ping. FPS is basically the refresh rate your computer runs. An
          avergae computer might run at 60 Frames Per Second, but if something
          that causes your computer to lag (like high CPU usage from this game,
          or some internet troubles), your FPS will decrease. You will notice
          this naturally when you see lag. Ping (the technical term is latency)
          means the time it takes for data to be tansmitted from your device to
          the server. When you join a game in Tackle Tanks, if the Host lives
          somewhere very far from you, laggines will show up. If you enable FPS
          and Ping, you can see how much time data reaches your server and back.
          20 m/s or less is very great ping. 100m/s or more is bad ping. If you
          are a host, your ping is 0 m/s, because you are the connector.<br /><br />The
          next two options is "Effects" and "Particles". There are various
          effects in Tackle Tanks. For example, when you see fire in the game,
          you visibly see orange flames stretching and dilating. This motion is
          caused by an effect by our software. Particles on the hand, are
          objects you see. When you are in any of the maps, you will see
          flowers. These flowers is a particle. Particles have no collision, but
          it takes space, making the CPU usage to rise. More CPU usage means
          more lag. If your computer can't handle these particles and effects,
          disable both of these.<br /><br />"Object Limiter" is the next option.
          Here, you can set the number of objects in your game. Trees, rocks,
          anything with collision, are mandatory objects. Since there around
          1000 mandatory objects in any given game, this is set as the minimum
          number. If you enter a number below this, it will set it to 0, meaning
          there is no limit. The maximum is 2000 because it is not possible for
          this game to have anymore than 2000 objects at a time. Some objects
          might not disapear if you are host.<br /><br />Lastly, the final
          option is the red warning button. This is asking to clear ALL of your
          user data. There is no going back if you click this option. All your
          skins, stats, even your settings, will disappear. Your progress will
          be reset. Don't worry, if you accidentally click this, another warning
          prompt will appear. Here you can click cancel.<br /><br />
          After editting and modifying everything to suit you needs, scroll at
          the very top of the page. Here, you can click "Save". Do not click out
          of the page because it will not save. There is another button titled
          "Reset to Default". As the name implies, if you click it, it will
          reset all of settings, returning everything to the default.

        <h3 id="basicgameplay"><br />Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          The mechanics of this game is very simple, allowing all players to
          enjoy. Each user is a tank. You can control the tank by moving up,
          down left, or right (default is WASD, arrow keys are constant). You
          can aim and fire using your gun or ability (Default is left mouse to
          shoot and right mouse to aim, Space is constant). Every tank has a
          main weapon and two secondary abilities. There are limits. Gun Cool is
          a varible that affects your firing. Each tank afflict this variable at
          different speeds. For example, the
          <a href="#sniper">Sniper Tank<sub>[21]</sub></a> can only fire three
          times back to back until the gun heat disallows you to shoot. The gun
          will have to fully cool in order to shoot again.<br /><br />The
          abilities have limits as well. Every ability will have timer based on
          how powerful they are. For example,
          <a href="#recon">Recon's Airstrike<sub>[20]</sub></a> has a cooldown
          of 120 seconds before it can be used again. This is because the
          airstike is massive and has devestating effect. Each tank has at least
          one defensive and one offensive ability.<br /><br />The baseline
          integrity for all tanks is 1000hp. In order to fully destroy a tank,
          you must deplete their health. There are two types of damage,
          Explosive damage and Impact damage. Impact damage is the damage caused
          by collision of a projectile (For example,
          <a href="#cannon">Cannon's cannonball<sub>[10]</sub></a> damages when
          it collides against a tank). Explosive damage, as the name suggest, is
          damage caused by explosions, an area effect, contrary to impact. If a
          kerosene can blows up, it causes damage over a short period of time
          (the longer the tank collides with the explosion, the more damage the
          tank recieves). Explosive damage, decreases the farther away you are
          from the explosion. Impact damage is constant.<br /><br />After each
          match, you are rewarded Scraps (in-game currency) based on what you
          did on the battlefeild. Even though you might have lost the match, you
          will be rewarded. During the game you can find your stats by pressing
          the Leaderboard button in the bottom right corner.
        </p>
        <h5>
          To save your scraps, make sure you click the leave button. Anything
          else (reloading, back page, ect) will result in a loss of your hard
          earned rewards. Scraps are automatically saved after each match.
        </h5>
        <p>
          The scraps you earn can be used to buy different skins. These skins
          are located back on the main page in the tope left corner. Here you
          can also find the amount of Scraps. Once you click the shop button,
          you will land on the shop page, where you can select the skins you
          want to equip and buy skins if you have enough Scraps.
        </p>
        <h4 id="biHUD"><br />Basic User Interface and HUD</h4>
        <p>
          This section will give you all the information about the basic user
          interfaces. The UI that are purposed for a certain gamemode, like
          <a href="#capturethebases"
            >Capture The Bases's Base Information<sub>[26]</sub></a
          >, will be explained in the Gamemodes category. Any other general
          interface will be explained here.<br /><br />The first and most
          prominent design you might find is the health and gun cool indicators.
          The health bar, as named, tells you the total integrity of your tank.
          Another indication of your health would be the damage indicated on
          your tank. Your gun temperature is marked by the red gauge. The higher
          the temperature, the more it reaches the end point. If the end point
          is reached. A red LED will flash on, indicating that you can no longer
          fire.<br /><br />Just above the health bar is two abilities. Both
          abilities can be clicked to activate it (or re-clicked to cancel).
          After the ability is used, the button will turn dark and display the
          time it takes until you can activate it again.<br /><br />The next
          interface can be seen in the top left. Here, you will find the current
          objective and the time until the match ends. Below the time you will
          see the current Tackle Leader. The Tackle Leader tally will be shown
          based on gamemode (For example,
          <a href="#capturethebases">Team Deathmatch's<sub>[25]</sub></a> Tackle
          Leader is based the amount of XP you earn).<br /><br />In the top
          right corner you will find the kill feed. If you destroy another
          player, it'll show here. If you accidently destroy yourself in any
          case, it will also show up in the Kill Feed. If you are destroyed, you
          will land on the spectate page. Here you'll find the current person
          you're watching and arrows to change who you want to watch. You can
          see their current gun cool and integrity (in the place where yours
          would be). After 10 seconds, you can click the respawn button to
          respawn (if there is respawn in the gamemode you are playing).<br /><br />
          In certain cases, you can controll a gadget. Each gadget that you can
          control will have ethier have "Detonate" button or a Recall "button".
          Just as the name suggests, you can click this button (or press the
          default key "X") to detonate or call back your gadget. You will not be
          able to see your integrity, guncool, or powerups during this time.<br /><br />
          Finally, each tank has their own cursor. This cursor will always face
          the direction you would want to fire. Make sure that you nozzle is in
          the direction to fire before you do shoot. Every tank has a rotate
          speed for their turret. It takes about 1.25 seconds for your nozzle to
          turn 180 degrees.<br /><br />
          There are other small and minor UI, such as the pop up to select your
          tank, but it's very self explanitory.
        </p>
        <h4 id="TAPS"><br />Targeting and Ping System</h4>
        <p>
          Targeting enemies is another key factor in this game. Certain power
          ups, passive abilities, and gadgets have the ability to ping an enemy
          tanker (for example,
          <a href="#scout">Scout's UAV<sub>[19]</sub></a> pings enemies as you
          fly over them). <br /><br />
          If someone pings an enemy, everyone on their team will be able to see
          the ping. In order to see the ping, there are arrows that point to the
          enemy on your screen (there is a radius around your tank that provides
          pointers). An enemy will not know that they are pinged, nor their
          team. This goes for your team as well: everyone in your team are
          vulnerable of being targeted without them even knowing it.<br /><br />
          If you target an enemy, the ping's heighlight will not last forever.
          It will disapear after about 5 seconds. <br /><br />There are other
          pointers that are not targeted enemies. Yellow arrows are created by
          <a href="#recon">Recon's Move Marker<sub>[20]</sub></a
          >, which points you in the general direction of where most of the
          enemy team is (or whatever your fellow Recon targeted).
          <a href="#capturethebases">Capture The Bases<sub>[26]</sub></a> also
          displays pointers. A team colored arrow (green or orange) will point
          towards a base. The greener it is, the more the Green Team captured
          the base, the more orange, the Orange Team. The more white the arrow,
          the more neutral the base is.
        </p>
        <h4 id="xpmeritsystem"><br />XP Merit and Scoring System</h4>
        <p>
          XP, also known as your score, is earned by doing various actions that
          will propel you to team victory. There is no way to lose XP, you can
          only be reward. The more XP you earn, the more Scraps you earn. In
          most game modes, Tackle Leader is based on someone who earns the most
          XP. At the end of a match, you are reward scraps based on the team win
          ratings, how much XP you earned, and the placement you are in. if you
          are first place in rank, you are reward more Scraps. So generally,
          build your score by doing stuff!<br /><br />
          You are given different amounts of XP for different actions. Here, a
          list will show you how much for each action:
        </p>
        <p class="green-highlight">
          Eliminating an Oppenent - 1000xp<br />5 HP worth of Damage - 4xp
          (Continuous adding for each damage)<br />Spot Assist - 25xp<br />Gadget
          Destroy - 25xp
